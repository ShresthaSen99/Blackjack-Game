Rules of Blackjack game:-

1. In blackjack, each player and dealer receives two cards randomly. 
2. The player can then choose to “play” (request another card) or “stop” (keep on hold until a new request is made). The goal in this game is to keep the sum of all card points equal to 21 without exceeding it.
3. Face cards (i.e. Jack, Queen, and King) are worth 10 points, and Aces can be worth 11 points. If a player has more than 21 points then the player automatically loses the game.
